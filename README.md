# ASR: Archival Solar flaRes catalogue 
Solar flares result from the rapid conversion of stored magnetic energy within the Sun's corona. These energy releases occur in coronal magnetic loops, rooted in dense photospheric plasma and passively transported by surface advection. Their emissions span a broad range of wavelengths, with soft X-rays serving as the primary diagnostic for the past fifty years.

Despite extensive research, a complete theory explaining both the statistical and individual properties of flares remains elusive. This project leverages stable, long-term soft X-ray measurements from NASA's GOES mission to construct a new solar flare catalogue, introducing a novel approach to linking sympathetic events.

For the most energetic flares since 2010, we provide a method to identify their origin and establish connections to photospheric active regions using data from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory. This catalogue serves as a valuable resource for studying space weather and training machine learning models to enhance early warning systems for eruptive solar events.
